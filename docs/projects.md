# Project Standards and Practices

## Configuration

### README

Be sure to include a README with your project that includes any special cases someone else
will need to accomplish in order to build the assets.

You can also include notes on your project that you feel are important to know for a dev
picking up the project.

## Code Reviews

Code reviews are encouraged for static projects. They help reduce errors and help enforce coding standards.

All code reviews should enforce standards to the closest degree, and exceptions should be documented and well-explained.

Code reviews can be done in person or via email.
