For any project:

* Consistency and conventions between team members is paramount.
* Solutions should be as simple and clear as possible.
* Solutions should serve a specific purpose.
* Clever code does not mean good code; readability is critical.
* Complex code solutions should be documented via comments, and if possible, documented elsewhere in a deliverable format (PDF, DOCX, etc).

A key hallmark of professional code includes a notion that while we are writing code, we must reach a desired goal, and we must also create code that can be read and understood by others.
