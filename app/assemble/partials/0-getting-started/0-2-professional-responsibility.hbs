We are experts in our field creating solutions for our clients and their audiences, not for ourselves. Every technology and code choice needs to be measured against the benefits to the project versus the cool factor or how trendy a particular solution may be.

Our industry is wrought with the flavor of the month, so please be deliberate.

Always remember that just because you can does not mean you should. Some solutions are not reliable, may not perform well, or may be difficult to maintain over time or add more code to. Always remember your code may not be the last added to a project in that particular feature area.
