Please consistently indent, nest, include braces, quotes, and newlines so that code is clear and can be read easily. New code that is added should never deviate from existing formatting conventions or change the indent levels.

For all code languages, we require the use of hard tabs at all times.

You may modify your editor-of-choice to display tabs as 4 spaces, but they should exist as tabs to maintain consistency.
