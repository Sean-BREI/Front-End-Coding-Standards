At the outset of the project it is essential to **properly understand the goals of the project** and **identify the specific deliverables** expected of the front-end team. Where your responsibilities begin and end should not be taken for granted or assumed.

It's important to understand how the development environment will work, what tools will be available, and what the differences between development, test, and production environments may ultimately be.

Finally, all project teams should get a reasonable understanding of the what client's **browser and device requirements** are. Make no assumptions as to the technology available either from the client or their audience.
