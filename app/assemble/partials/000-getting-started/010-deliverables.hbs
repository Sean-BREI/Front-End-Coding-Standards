Quality deliverables are essential for professionals. Sloppy or messy deliverables are unprofessional and reflect poorly on the final product and the delivery team. Please remove legacy files, be certain the work is delivered in a clean file system, and in an orderly, logical structure that serves a clear purpose.

Unless specifically requested, delivery of code should be a zip of the compiled static assets. If the client desires a part of the unbuilt project or the entire project itself, documentation should be prepared for the client accordingly, and minimal support offered.
