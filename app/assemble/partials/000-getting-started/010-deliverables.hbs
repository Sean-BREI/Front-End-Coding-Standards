Quality deliverables are essential for professionals. Sloppy or messy deliverables are unprofessional and reflect poorly on the final product and the delivery team. Please remove legacy files, be certain the work is delivered in a clean file system, and in an orderly, logical structure that serves a clear purpose.

Unless specifically requested, delivery of code should be a zip of the compiled static assets. If the client desires a part of the unbuilt project or the entire project itself, documentation should be prepared for the client accordingly, and minimal support offered. If a client does receive the code base for a project, they must be made aware that any changes made on their end are separated from our final version of the code and will be the sole responsibility of the client.

The deployment of a project may be satisfied by the integration of the template into their CMS or hosted server.

There is no official standard of project documentation at BarkleyREI yet, but as much documentation as is possible should be provided along with finished code.
