This document contains the guidelines and best practices for the front-end web development team at BarkleyREI.

Each item here represents either:

1. A reminder to follow existing standards or industry conventions,
2. guidance on what constitutes professional patterns and organization, or
3. a decision we've made favoring one method over its alternatives.

What this document is not is a series of explanations as to how front-end technologies work; a basic familiarity is assumed. It also does not provide evaluations of the pros and cons of various alternatives unless there is common confusion about which option is best; when appropriate we pick what we consider to be the best solutions and present them. Issues that don't yet have a clear solution are considered flexible and may or may not be listed.
