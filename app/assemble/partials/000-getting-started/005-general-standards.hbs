For any project:

* Consistency and conventions between team members is paramount.
* Solutions should be as simple and clear as possible.
* Solutions should serve a specific purpose.
* Clever code does not mean good code; readability is critical.

A key hallmark of professional code includes a notion that while we are writing code that must reach a desired goal, we are also creating code that must be read and understood by others.
