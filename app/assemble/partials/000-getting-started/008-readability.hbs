We encourage liberal use of whitespace, comments, and descriptive variable names as appropriate for writing easy-to-read code.

There is no need to write code in an obfuscated or compressed way for the purpose of file-size savings.

We will use build processes to optimize files; this includes concatenating files, code minification, gzipping, and setting "Far Future Expires".

The ability for another developer to read the code is paramount above other concerns, especially if optimization can be handled another way.
