All input fields should be associated with a `<label>` element. The for attribute of the `<label>` element should contain the ID of the corresponding input field. This means the input field will receive focus when a user clicks the label and also enables screen readers for sight-impaired users to read out an appropriate description of the input field.

{{#code "html"}}
<label for="home-address">Home Address</label>
<input id="home-address" type="text" />
{{/code}}

You can also, alternatively, place the input for the label inside the label itself. This allows you many style opportunities to use the label as a container to align or place the form element in specific configurations.

{{#code "html"}}
<label for="home-address">
	<span>Home Address</span>
	<input id="home-address" type="text" />
</label>
