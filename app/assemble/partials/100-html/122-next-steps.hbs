Considerations:

* Site maintenance procedures.
* Browser testing strategies.
* How new features will be added.
* Where new features will be added.
* What the file system looks like for static site assets.
* If a CDN is involved.
* Naming conventions and organization of graphics and photography assets.
* If the "back-end implementation" of static HTML templates will require review by front-end team members.
