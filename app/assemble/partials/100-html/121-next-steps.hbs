Considerations:

1. Site maintenance procedures
2. Browser testing strategies
3. How new features will be added
4. Where new features will be added
5. What the file system looks like for static site assets
6. If a CDN is involved
7. Naming conventions and organization of graphics and photography assets
8. If the "back-end implementation" of static HTML templates will require review by front-end team members
