HTML provides a number of [semantic constructs](http://www.bbc.co.uk/guidelines/futuremedia/technical/semantic_markup.shtml) that allow automated tools like search engines and screen readers to make sense of the document and to understand relationships between pieces of content. Use semantic markup whenever possible â€” that is to say use elements with specific meanings for specific purposes to convey the spirit of the markup.

A well-written HTML document will make appropriate use of these semantic elements and leave all responsibility for controlling the presentation of the document to the CSS style sheet.
