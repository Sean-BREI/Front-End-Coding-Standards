For both semantic and functional reasons, we make full use of the `<form>` tag for all sections requiring user input. All form action attributes should point to URLs with user-readable content, so they will still work if the form is submitted by the user before JavaScript has loaded on a page, or if JavaScript is broken, disabled, or not supported. This will require that the back-end be able to return a full HTML page for form submission (e.g. registering a new user, editing the quantity in a shopping cart).

Do not nest the HTML form element tag.
