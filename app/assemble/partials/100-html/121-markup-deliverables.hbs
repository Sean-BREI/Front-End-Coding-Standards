Typically HTML deliverables are incorporated into CMS's or application delivery platforms as templates. A plan for incorporation of templates that leverage patterns created during the markup creation phase should be followed and matching types of pages to templates that were created, so that an association between the source markup and the destination markup can be maintained over time.

If the templates built are not being integrated into a CMS by BarkleyREI, the static coded versions of these templates can be provided as a deliverable.
