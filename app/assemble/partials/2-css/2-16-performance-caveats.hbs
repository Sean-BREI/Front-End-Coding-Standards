In some cases for performance reasons it may be good practice to in-line critical styles in a `style` block in the document's head. This delivers these styles to the browser in the fastest method possible by preventing the need for an additional HTTP request. Fetching linked style sheets are a blocking operation on the rendering of a Web page in a browser in most cases. An enormous CSS file can mean a highly reduced time to first rendering because a browser may pause during loading of the page to download CSS which may not even be used on the first page.

With the above in mind it may be desirable to include the rules required to render the top portions of a page (i.e. "Above the fold") in advance of styles loaded after the rendering begins. Critical styles can be identified either manually or through the use of a tool. Non critical styles can then be asynchronously loaded, increasing the perceived page load speed.

**BarkleyREI** does not currently implement critical styles as a technique.
