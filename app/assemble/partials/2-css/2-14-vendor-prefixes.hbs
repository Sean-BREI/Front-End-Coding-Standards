There is no need to manually type vendor prefixes. They will be automatically included by autoprefixer when the project is compiled. If your desired vendor prefix is not appearing, check the browserlist settings in your project. If you have to manually type a vendor prefix, put the standardized rule at the end to ensure browsers optimize and use the standard if they recognize it.

For example:
{{/markdown}}
{{#code "css"}}
.thing {
    -webkit-transition: all 100ms;
    transition: all 100ms;
}
{{/code}}
