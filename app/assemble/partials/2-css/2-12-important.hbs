Avoid using the !important keyword. Treat it like the nuclear option, only to be used in the most extreme of cases. This fundamentally destroys the specificity feature and can even break accessibility for some users.

There is usually another way to achieve the same goal without causing headaches for developers in the future who are either trying to debug a styling issue, or trying to use normal specificity to override a style for a particular element only to find that they can't.
