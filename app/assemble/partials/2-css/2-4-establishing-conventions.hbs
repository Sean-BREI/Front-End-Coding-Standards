Like other aspects of the code on a site, consistency is key. Areas of critical consistency include:

* Code formatting.
* Naming conventions.
* File and folder structure.
* Examples or sample code.
* How page components might be broken down or re-used.

On a large site never develop using a single CSS stylesheet, though a single file served for a page is best. To this end we often recommend the use of CSS preprocessors to break style sheets into smaller, better organized files, or the use of a build process to combine files for serving via HTTP.

Try to use the rule of three when building stylesheets for a website:

* Global site styles (Main.css).
* Template specific styles (Level vs. Home).
* Feature specific styles (One off page).

**Note:**

It is a great idea to approach front-end development like a set of [reusable components](http://patternlab.io/) are being created. This matches how they are designed, how they must adapt to responsive layouts, and how they will be implemented inside content management or other server-side frameworks.
