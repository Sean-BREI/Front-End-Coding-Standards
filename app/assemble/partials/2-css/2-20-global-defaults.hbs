For the purposes of discussion we could refer to the global defaults as the baseline HTML elements and their associated styles. Frequently you may wish to use a third party library which normalizes CSS behavior across browsers. Either way, it makes sense to keep these files in their own files.

BarkleyREI uses Foundation to reset styles, which in turn uses Normalize.css.

Print styles should be contained within a separate stylesheet, and should be applied with `<link>` tags set to the appropriate media statement so that they style the unstyled document.

{{#code "html"}}
<link rel="stylesheet" media="screen" href="main.css" />

<!-- print styles are seperate and style the plain document -->
<link rel="stylesheet" media="print" href="print.css" />
