All styles should be written in [Sass (Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets)](http://sass-lang.com/) unless specifically requested otherwise by management or the client. The structure of the Sass in the project should follow the [SCSS Boilerplate](https://github.com/BarkleyREI/brei-sass-boilerplate) on our Github.

Refer to the ["Formatting SCSS"](#section-209-formatting-scss) section of this document for more information on writing Sass styles.
