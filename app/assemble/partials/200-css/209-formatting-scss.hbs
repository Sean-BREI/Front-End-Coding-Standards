Basic rules for formatting SCSS files:

* The ordering of styles should be:
    * @extend
    * @includes (without inner content)
    * Regular styles
    * @includes (with inner content)
    * Nested rule sets
* Nested rule sets should follow the same ordering of styles.
* Foundation breakpoints should be placed inside the selector they directly affect, and should not contain nested styles.
* Nesting shouldn’t go deeper than 4 levels.
* Nested statements shouldn’t be longer than 50 lines.
* Only use variables or functions for colors in a module/partial.
    * Try to use specifically named variables instead of the raw color names. For example, `$header-outer-border-color` instead of `$congress-blue;`
* Surround all pixel values in `rem-calc()`

Inside sets of rules or style declarations:
* Omit an empty line between the top and bottom of a nested block.
* Add empty lines in between nested blocks.
