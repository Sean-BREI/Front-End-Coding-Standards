There are a number of popular design patterns for naming conventions on selectors, groupings or extensions of styles in CSS files. Sometimes these are of value and may be used on projects as long as the developers are on board and they are used consistently by the team.

Examples of pattern systems include BEM, SMACSS, Object Oriented CSS, Atomic design, and others.

The downsides to some of these systems are:

* Often rely on less obvious rules that may be difficult to follow.
* They may use syntax that may be objectionable to some developers.
* Some developers may find the syntax difficult to read.

For these reasons it is often best to go with the most simple, basic set of conventions possible, based on obvious patterns.

BarkleyREI does not currently follow a coding pattern for CSS/SCSS.
