A utility is a type of component modifier that is specifically designed to be used on more than one component type. If it was restricted to a single component, it would simply be a modifier.

Utilities should serve only the modifier purpose intended without side effects when applied to any component, or component descendant. In the examples below, the prefix `u-` is being used for utilities.
