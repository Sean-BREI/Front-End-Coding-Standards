As noted above, use the lowest level of specificity necessary to get the desired results. This means the use of the ID selector should be minimized. Often creating a new class is preferable to using inheritance or additional specificity to target an element or elements.

ID selectors, if used, should be used mainly as access points for JavaScript or if a very particular use case surfaces. Styles and classes can be applied via the same element with a className.

SCSS Lint will flag the use of IDs, so if they are absolutely required, they must be excluded via `scss-lint:disable` statements.
