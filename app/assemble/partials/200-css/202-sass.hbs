All styles should be written in Sass (Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets) unless specifically requested otherwise by management or the client. The structure of the Sass in the project should follow the SCSS Boilerplate on our Github.

Refer to the "Formatting SCSS" section of this document for more information on writing Sass styles.
