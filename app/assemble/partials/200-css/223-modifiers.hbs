If you need to extend an existing component then create distinct modifier classes to easily indicate that it is a modifier and not a complete style. Using a prefix can prevent confusing the class with a full class. In the examples below, we are using the `mod-` prefix to identify modifiers.
{{/markdown}}
{{#code "css"}}
.mod-modifier-a { ... }
.mod-modifier-b { ... }
{{/code}}
{{#markdown}}
Then, when used in the HTML, the class stands out:
{{/markdown}}
{{#code "html"}}
<div class="component-content mod-modifier-a">...</div>
{{/code}}
{{#markdown}}
This is a strong technique because the modifier classes can stand on their own in the CSS. Further, they may also be altered via more complex rules:
{{/markdown}}
{{#code "css"}}
.component-header.mod-modifier-a { ... }
{{/code}}
{{#markdown}}
This is simplistic and easy to follow, understand, and expand upon.
