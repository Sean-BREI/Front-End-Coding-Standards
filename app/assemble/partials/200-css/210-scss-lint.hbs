All BarkleyREI projects are linted by SCSS-Lint to detect and alert style issues with SCSS files. We adhere to [all the defaults located here](https://github.com/brigade/scss-lint/blob/master/lib/scss_lint/linter/README.md) with the exceptions of the following:

* *__DeclarationOrder__* is set to false
    * This causes issues with Foundation's breakpoint() mixin.
* *__EmptyRule__* is set to false
    * These are removed in the final compiled file anyway, and this plays nice with our generator.
* *__HexLength__* is enabled and set to “long” (requiring 6 characters always)
* *__ImportPath__* has leading_underscore set to true
* *__Indentation__* has character set to “tab” and width set to “1”
* *__LeadingZero__* is enabled and style set to “include_zero”
* *__NestingDepth__* is enabled and max_depth is set to “4”
* *__PropertySortOrder__* is set to false
    * This is difficult to enforce but we may pursue this later.
* *__PseudoElement__* is set to false
    * I've noticed that two colons fails in some browsers but I'm not certain.
* *__QualifyingElement__* has “allow_element_with_attribute” set to “true”
* *__SelectorDepth__* has “max_depth” set to “4”
* *__SpaceAroundOperator__* is set to false
    * Requested by Sarah and approved by Ian
* *__TrailingWhitespace__* is set to false
* *__TrailingZero__* is set to true
* *__TransitionAll__* is set to true
    * You should only transition specific properties

Excluding SCSS from linting should be avoided, but in the fringe case that you must remove linting from a specific section of a SCSS file, this can be achieved by the following example:
{{/markdown}}
{{#code "css"}}
.search {
	// scss-lint:disable VendorPrefix
	::-webkit-input-placeholder {
		color: $placeholder-text-color;
		font-style: italic;
	}
	// scss-lint:enable VendorPrefix
}
{{/code}}
{{#markdown}}
You must always deactivate only the rules you need, for only the lines you need. If an entire scss file needs excluded from linting, one of the following must occur:

* It should be rewritten so that it passes without disabling rules.
* It should be rewritten so that only the affected lines are excluded.
* It should be moved to an excluded directory (like plugins, if you are importing styles from a third party component).
