Do not hard code style information into your HTML markup directly, either with the style attribute that accepts CSS or with deprecated attributes such as align, border, or width. These are difficult to maintain and make it harder to track down what is causing an element to appear as it does.

An exception to this is background images that may be changeable by the client.
