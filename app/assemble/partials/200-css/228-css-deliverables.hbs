Please be aware of potential conflicts between the original development environment for CSS and an ultimate deployment to production systems, if continuous integration will allow the continued use of CSS preprocessors, or if there should a cross-platform development strategy.

Delivered CSS should be concatenated, minified, tested against browser bugs (e.g. MSIE selector count bugs) and extra files should be removed.

File naming conventions should be consistent and language or use-case specific files should be clear and not be easily confused with the global style CSS.

Uncompiled SCSS files can be provided to the client upon request. Appropriate documentation should be given on how to compile them.
