For a given project, check Web server logs, current industry statistics and trends, and consult with a client on their audience and proposed use cases when determining a baseline set of devices to build the site and test for.

What types of users are there? Is an audience:

* Working on their commute from a bus or train?
* Paying bills or their taxes on the go?
* Accessioning financial information with their clients on the go, over lunch?
* Entering sales figures remotely?
* Enjoying witty content or editorials?
* Comfortably browsing for fun at home?

It is near impossible to test on every version of every platform, particularly with something like Android where fragmentation of the feature set is totally unpredictable. Comparison of platforms and statistics regarding particular releases of particular versions of an operating system may need to be considered.
