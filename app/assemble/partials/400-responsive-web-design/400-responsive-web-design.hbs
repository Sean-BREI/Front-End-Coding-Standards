Responsive Web Design (RWD) is the term used for the practice of creating page layouts and user experiences that work on a variety of devices and screen sizes.

With the ever expanding mobile landscape and the evolution of the Internet of Things (IoT), the idea of a "standard" screen size has fallen by the wayside in favor of the rise of a device-agnostic approach. It is less and less common to launch two versions of a site, one for desktop and one for mobile.

To this end a series of techniques have been put together for pages to adjust based off browser's' current specs (e.g. width, height, pixel density, orientation, etc).

The techniques are referred to as Responsive Web Design (RWD) and it is another technique in the toolbox of progressive enhancement and adaptive web design.
