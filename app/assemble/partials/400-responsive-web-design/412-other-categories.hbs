Virtually everything can change when screen sizes change:

* Grids
* Typography
* Accessible forms / validation messages
* Main site navigation
* Header or Footer content
* In-page navigation, such as tabbed navigation, or accordions
* Images
* Data tables
* Interactions and animations
* Advertising types
* Performance metrics
