As the name of RWD implies, it all starts with a flexible design that features components having mutable characteristics based on the available screen canvas and varied types of user interactions. Careful consideration needs to be taken when innovating to derive a design that can respond to various screens.

For a given project, always consider:

* The extent of the use cases for each feature on the site.
* The target audience and likelihood they may be using an alternative device to conduct certain activities on the site.
* If all target devices will support all the technologies required.
* That the UX will **not** be 100% the same across all devices, browsers and screens â€” nor should it be!
* What happens to the design when the screen gets smaller **and larger** than the static canvas size it is being designed on.
* For placement of content and decorative elements, are there patterns or rules that can describe where it falls and adjust with screen sizes?
* Will some components be better suited as vector graphics (SVG or fonts) instead of raster files to allow for distortion free scaling?
* Will assets need to be produced in different formats for different devices (e.g. HTML5 video, lower resolution artwork vs. high resolution artwork, smaller file sizes vs. larger sizes).
* If a device offers a superior UX for some types of interaction (e.g. native date-pickers vs. traditional browser controls, or swiping instead of clicking on dots).
* What happens when a feature is not supported by a device, or if a feature were to fail in a given device?
* What if a device went off-line during usage of a feature?
* The best ways to detect support for various features (e.g. Modernizr, etc.).
