Large horizontal navigation and mega-drop downs are not always practical on smaller screens. Frequently this means off-canvas navigation, collapsing menus into select boxes, or other approaches such as a full-screen overlay.

[Progressive and Responsive Navigation](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2012/02/progressive-and-responsive-navigation/) is a great example of modifying the types of menu based on screen size.

[Responsive Navigation Patterns](http://bradfrost.com/blog/web/responsive-nav-patterns/) and [Complex Navigation Patterns](http://bradfrost.com/blog/web/complex-navigation-patterns-for-responsive-design/)

How navigation changes per screen size will depend entirely on the requirements and design for the project.
