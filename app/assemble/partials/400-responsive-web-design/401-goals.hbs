The goals of RWD are:

* Offer an optimized user experience (UX),
* regardless of the user's screen size or features supported on their device.

This is true whether it is a stadium jumbotron or the screen of a watch â€” and of course everything between.

Despite this lofty ideal, on Web projects the term "responsive web design" has generally been used in reference to an optimized experience for a set of target devices, usually:

* A particular set of cell (smart) phones,
* various tablets,
* or desktop computer monitors (depending upon the target audience).

Typically reasonable effort is applied to accommodate the ideal UX for devices with screen sizes that fall outside of and in between.

Overall, critical content and features on a site should be:

* Adjustable to different types of user interaction (e.g. click, swipe, pinch)
* Realistically accessible based on the capabilities of different devices.

If meeting desktop browsers' feature sets and dealing with different platforms was difficult before, RWD introduces an almost infinite ecosystem of hardware and software that Web pages need to work on. The level of effort does often increase on projects featuring RWD.
