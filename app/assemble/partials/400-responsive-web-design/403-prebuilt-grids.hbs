Sometimes CSS grid frameworks are a good place to start ... but sometimes not.

They must match the design in terms of flexibility.

It's critical a developer learn the basics of how grid systems.

It may be beneficial to learn the coming Flexbox techniques as well.

While using a Framework isn't always the way to go, there is much to be learned from examining how they work and how they are put together.

BarkleyREI uses Foundation as a grid system, but it is not a requirement to build layout.
