To avoid confusion between global and local variables, we declare each variable on its own line with the var keyword. We do not use a single var keyword and then chain several variable declarations onto it separated by a comma.

{{#code "javascript"}}
var windowWidth;
var windowHeight;
var currentVal = $(this).val();
var min = parseInt($(this).attr('min'), 10);

This has been [debated at length](http://benalman.com/news/2012/05/multiple-var-statements-javascript/) and is controversial, however we believe this is a better practice due to several technical reasons:

* Easier debugging with debuggers.
* Easier merges with version control and diff utilities.
* Most technical issues are resolved by 'use strict'.
