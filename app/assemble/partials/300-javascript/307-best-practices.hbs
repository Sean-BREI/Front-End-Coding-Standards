The following guidelines are general best practices for writing JavaScript at BarkleyREI.

* Avoid user-agent sniffing and rely on feature detection instead. Browser detection is dangerous and error-prone.
* Avoid using document.write.
* Only run scripts on a page that are needed for that page.
* Don't repeat yourself (i.e. keep your code DRY)
* Do not modify JavaScript core objects .prototype unless you really know what you're doing.
* Use method names that make sense, such as init() or setup() for code that starts things off. Be consistent on your project.
