On some sites it may be appropriate to load a single JavaScript file with all dependencies bundled together, or it may be more appropriate (such as in a very large SPA) to load files on demand, as they are needed, asynchronously.

BarkleyREI doesn not currently use asynchronous bundling methods to load JavaScript into the page.
