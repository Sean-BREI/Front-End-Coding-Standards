Selection of a library or framework is never an easy task. Things that should be considered include:

* Technical Requirements for the project.
* Quality and maturity of code in question.
* Future support for the code.
* Staffing skill sets required to support the code.
* How tightly coupled to the layers of the application the code may be.
* How actively supported its open source community may be.
* Be tested against various devices and platform requirements to verify it works for the project.
