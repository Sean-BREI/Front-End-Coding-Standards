Third party code should be included as-is and:

* Treated as it may be updated (i.e. versions) at some point in the future.
* Should **never be modified** unless documented thoroughly for the project.
* As many conventions of its use followed in their recommended standard ways.
* Un-minified code should be included.
* Any required licenses should be included as specified by the library.
* Commercial code must be approved if necessary.

A team may decide to write wrapper code around the third party library and provide a more simple API for the code.
