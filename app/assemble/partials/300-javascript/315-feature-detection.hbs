Always test for the existence of a browser API, function, or object property before you use it, and make sure the user experience is still functional (to the extent possible) if it's not found. We rely on JavaScript-based feature detection rather than server-side device detection because it's more robust, easily maintained, and future-proof.

The goto library for feature detection is of course [Modernizr](http://modernizr.com/).
