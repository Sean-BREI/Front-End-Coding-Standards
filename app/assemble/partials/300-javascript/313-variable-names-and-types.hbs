Always use meaningful variable names that can be read as words, not as silly abbreviations only you understand.

* Variable names should be camelCase.
* Objects, classes, and name-spaces should be TitleCase.
* Boolean values should be prefixed with is if at all possible.
* Cached jQuery objects can be prefixed with $.
* Use shorthand versions of empty Arrays and Objects.

// some examples
var exampleValue = 'my example variable value';
var numberOfTimes = 3;
// booleans
var isThisWorking = true;
var isNotWorking = 0;
// cache a selector
var $body = $('body');
// short hand objects and arrays
var newObject = {};
var newArray = [];
