Unless we are talking about a complex client-side Single Page Application (SPA), JavaScript should be used sparingly, and when a deliberate choice is made to not perform a task with other available technologies. The decision to add more scripts to a Web page should be made carefully. Even with a SPA, it is critical to make controlled choices so as to not include too much unorganized impossible to maintain code.

Any and all JavaScript code that's added to a Web page should be there if and only if it is needed for the page to achieve the desired ends or if there aren't any negative impacts with it there.

Included JavaScript should:

* Be included after careful consideration.
* Have the performance overhead and file size evaluated.
* Have a feature set that is understood and appropriate.
* Perform only the necessary tasks without needless overhead.
* Have maintainability carefully assessed.

While being:

* Fast, efficient, and perform well.
* Re-usable if possible.
* Not conflict with other code on a given page or sets of pages.
* Executed only when necessary on a given page or sets of pages.

Likewise, the absence or failure of the code should be carefully considered:

* What happens if for some reason this code is missing or does not run?
* What happens if the code triggers an error?
