JavaScript is where extra behaviors, features, and functionality not offered natively by Web browsers through CSS and HTML is created.

JavaScript has gained an enormous amount of attention in recent years due to more feature rich, faster browsers and server run-times such as Node.js. For the purposes of this document, general discussion here focuses on client-side JavaScript development, with references to where it crosses over.

It is of note that many techniques identified these days as "HTML5" are actually enabled by the related JavaScript APIs.
