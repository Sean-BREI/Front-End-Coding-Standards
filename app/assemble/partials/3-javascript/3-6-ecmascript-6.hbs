Developers are encouraged to begin learning and using the [latest version of JavaScript, ES6](https://leanpub.com/understandinges6/read/). Please use appropriate transpilers and never release untested or unsupported code in the deliverables. Do **not** assume a feature [is supported](https://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es6/) in a browser.

BarkleyREI currently writes JavaScript using ECMAScript 6 standards and transpiles code using tools such as Babel, an open-source JS compiler, and Webpack, an open-source JS module bundler, to create ES5 equivalent files that are supported in both modern and older browsers alike.
