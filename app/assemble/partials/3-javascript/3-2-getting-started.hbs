All too often a developer will solve a problem in a closed context and not consider the whole picture. "Add another plugin" is not always a good answer.

It is well worth considering if parts or all of the code being added can be useful elsewhere. Centralized code is excellent because it can be updated once and re-used everywhere.

For JavaScript, a Front-end developer should be thinking about:

* If there is code that does this task already?
* Code formatting rules, naming conventions, file locations, etc.
* Testing the code on various browsers and devices.
* If strings of text should be external for content management or translation.
* If code being added might be useful outside of the current problem.

Examples of possible things to centralize:

* Code that modifies the DOM
* Ajax, validation, or other libraries
* Query string parsing utilities, router-type code
* Tests for global conditions (e.g. window size, feature support, etc.)
* Page, window, or document level events (e.g. Ajax, resize, etc.)
* UI controls (e.g. spinners, modals, tabs, etc.)
* Date handling utilities
* Files with strings of text in a given language
* Finally, settings and configuration options (e.g. paths to services, debug flags, duration settings, minimum or maximum values, etc.) are common things to set in a centralized, distinct place.

Alternatively, if a problem can be solved with a custom module and not a third-party library or plugin, this solution is preferred, as it keeps the costs of the project down while not including any irrelevant or unused code.

Bottom line, please understand what the JavaScript does and how it does it if you are including third party code.

**Note:**

Client buy-in may be necessary for the usage of JavaScript for some features. It may be a forgone conclusion but usage of libraries or custom code should be discussed with the team and client technical leads to be certain the teams are on the same page.
