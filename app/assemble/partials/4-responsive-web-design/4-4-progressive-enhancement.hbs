Since mobile phones and tablets are frequently the lower end in terms of capabilities, it is recommended to start with building the mobile experience first, and gradually add features. With this in mind, RWD could be considered a type of Progressive Enhancement, whereby users with basic devices can access basic content and features, however care is taken to layer on more sophisticated features for more powerful devices and desktop users.

With these techniques, users only get what their device or browser can handle, and feature detection can be used to add more features when appropriate â€” without breaking on less capable devices.
