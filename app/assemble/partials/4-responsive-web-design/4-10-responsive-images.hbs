The picture element and img with srcset are valid standards now, and supported in many browsers. They can be freely pursued, though polyfills may be needed for some browsers.

You can read about this element and the evolution and standard at [ResponsiveImages.org](http://responsiveimages.org/).

At this time, the `<picture>` tag is supported in most modern browsers, with additional support using the [Picturefill polyfill](https://scottjehl.github.io/picturefill/).

Some basic rules to follow:

* **Always** optimize your images using a tool such as Adobe Photoshop to assure you have the ideal image size and right amount of lossy compression.
* Run all images though a lossless compressor like [Compressor.io](https://compressor.io/), [Smush.it](https://smush.it/) or [ImageOptim](https://imageoptim.com/) (which has related tools also available as build-time scripts).

You can also consider “Compressive Images”, which are basically higher-resolution jpegs compressed at a higher percentage rate:

* [Compressive Images](http://filamentgroup.com/lab/rwd_img_compression/)
* [Retina Revolution](http://blog.netvlies.nl/design-interactie/retina-revolution/)
* [Compressive Image Tests](http://www.vanseodesign.com/web-design/compressive-image-tests/)

However, there are drawbacks:

* The browser tends to use significantly more memory when storing and resizing these higher resolution images than scaling them to fit a container.

What's important to realize is that this is changing faster than we can develop. What you do now will be obsolete very soon, so be sure to stay on top of current trends.
