Displaying data tables in a responsive way on Mobile sites is a challenge. There are only so many good ways to address this.

* Simply make a wrapper around the table and scroll horizontally.
* Have CSS rules which collapse the tables.
* Sometimes JavaScript might be used to hide/show certain less critical columns, however this does add overhead.
