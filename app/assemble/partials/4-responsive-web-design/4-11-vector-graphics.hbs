When working with an audience on unknown screen sizes and resolutions, as is the pretense in RWD, having graphics that can scale without degrading is a very appealing prospect. There are several vector implementation options.

Web fonts: Fonts are vectors. With the exposure of custom web fonts as part of the CSS level 2 specification, many developers have turned to custom font packages as a solution for icons and simple vectors.

* Pros: this option allows for easy control of vector color, size and usage
* Cons: all of the vectors single color and must be grouped others in one file.

SVG: SVG is an XML syntax for describing vector shapes.

* Pros: vectors can be manipulated by CSS and/or JavaScript and allows for complex filters, animations and transitions.
* Cons: SVG is only supported by IE9+

[Grumpicon](http://www.filamentgroup.com/lab/grumpicon-workflow.html) is a script that will detect SVG support and server the appropriate CSS (or needed fall back CSS code to assure compatibility.
