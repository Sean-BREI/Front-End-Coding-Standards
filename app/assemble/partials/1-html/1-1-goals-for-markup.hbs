Please follow conventions established for a given project so all team members can have the same expectations around document structure and markup.

Structural consistency is critical when talking about the types of pages being used on a site or in a Web app. The markup structure provides all the necessary hooks for scripting and behavior, so it's important that the appropriate hooks are in place.

A clear, clean, and concise HTML structure is also necessary for semantics, flexibility, and a **reliable deployment environment.** Do **not** deviate from established templates or patterns without team approval.

Which markup is used does matter:

* Use the most meaningful yet minimal markup required to present the styles and interaction required.
* Application-centric deliverables often have different types of requirements; please code accordingly.
* **Maintain a clear separation of concerns, avoid in-line styles and in-line JavaScript whenever possible.**
* Have reference implementations so that each team member knows what sorts of structures are appropriate, as well as where to add new code.
* Build pages as a **library of components**, in such a way that blocks of code can be broken up and reused when implemented.
* Be sure front-end code is compatible with destination environments and delivery platforms.

The flexible nature of HTML markup and how loosely browsers interpret markup sometimes lends itself to inconsistencies not always being discovered immediately. This belies the care necessary in crafting a document's structure and in following established patterns.
