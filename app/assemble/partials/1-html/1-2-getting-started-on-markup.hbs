When crafting the HTML for a website, environment or technical constraints may impact the type of markup that can be used. Please discuss the final delivery environment in depth with technical leads and clients so that pages are not structured or styled in some way that is not effective for the project solution.

Discuss types of:

* Templates and types of pages.
* Which sections of pages (i.e. components) are reused or managed by software vs. by hand.
* Frameworks, CSS grid systems (custom or otherwise).
* Server-Side delivery platforms.

Note that it is vital to take into account how the site will ultimately be maintained and who will be doing that work.
