[Valid markup](https://validator.w3.org/) is a goal but not a mandate. However, be aware validation can be an excellent starting place while debugging a Web page — especially if the problems are unusual.

If it becomes necessary, please have reasons for invalid markup — otherwise it is just sloppy code.

For W3C validation, we will strive to resolve as many reasonable issues that come up from validation as possible, but it should be understood that it may not be possible to resolve 100% of the issues. This should be reviewed by the developer and each issue considered for validity.
